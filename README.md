# WebsiteProject
My biggest website so far. I am definitely proud of this one. As this was being unused, I decided to remove all of the sensible informations and post it here

## DISCLAIMER

This project uses the Internet Protocole and stores the users IPs in a databse. It is to know that this project is NOT TO BE USED FOR ANY NON ETHICAL THINGS. I do not take any responsability if illegal uses are done with this website, and I will not support it.


The CSS part of this project was NOT MADE BY ME. The server side and the JS was made entirely by me.

### EVERYTHING MADE BY ME IS CLAIMED AND CANNOT BE SOLD

## So, the website?

We enter the website on the `index.html`, which is a login page. It uses (almost) the same system as my former project, [RobloxIPBanSystem](https://github.com/Daegatoya/RobloxIPBanSystem)

The first login will act as a register. If the user's IP is not stored in the database, it will create a new user for the person. Take note that if the user's IP is not stored BUT his ROBLOX ID is, a new account will be created under the new IP, but the password will remain the same as the account already exists. This prevents user from creating multiple passwords for the same user with a VPN.

Then, the code can be seen to understand how the rest works. It is pretty simple to look at, have a good one.
